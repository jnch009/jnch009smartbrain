Things to do:
**Register is not redirecting to home (FIXED)
**Register is not generating a jwt (In progress)
**Score is not persisting on refresh (FIXED but perhaps a better solution exists?)
    - one solution is to store the email of the user and get the profile based on that (APPLIED)

More descriptive error handling shown in the app rather than console.log (Good so far)
    1. Register a duplicate user does not show the correct message
    
Messages/Loading indicators
    1. Success messages will need to be added in, with a green background

Change text from 'your current rank is to your face count is or something similar'
Don't increment score if there are no faces (message too?)

For convenience:
Endpoint to delete all users
Endpoint to list all users

Nice to have:
Creating a profile page
Leaderboard
Incrementing score based on how many faces are in the picture rather than incrementing by 1
